# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a naturally curious data scientists who enjoys using data to understand, predict and optimize. I also love open source and the community!

After graduating in applied mathematics I was eager to use my knowledge in solving real world problems so I turned my focus to statistics and probability theory. I like to tackle problems by mapping them into mathematical models to be solved by leveraging the latest advancements in machine learning, data analysis and predictive modelling.

âœ¨ **Specialties**:
 - special ability to find a bug in the code,
 - design the architecture of a data science projects,
 - tweak ML models to better solve problems
 - novel usage of machine learning and data mining algorithms in real life

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about new advances in tehnology and how to use them in real life.
